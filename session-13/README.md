# Learning Pure React
In this session, we began to explore, bit-by-bit, what react could do independent of `JSX`.

We covered certain concepts such as:
- `React` and `ReactDOM` libraries
- Transpiling and rendering
- Component-based development
- The virtual DOM
- React Elements
- Children (`props.children`)

The session was recorded and here is [the video](https://youtu.be/3S3-9Dwm2gc)
