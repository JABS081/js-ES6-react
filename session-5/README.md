# Session 5; Day 12
We continued form where we stopped in [session 4](../session-4) and did together the assignment that was written in the [README](../session-4/README.md);
That is what you will find in the sub-directory **previous_assignment**.

And we went on to demostrate some more concepts in `JavaScript` that (we believed) are very important in our journey to becoming effective `react.js` developers.
That was what we stored in the sub-directory **more_about_js**.

The video of the recorded live session is available on YouTube, click [here](https://youtu.be/3e7Qrzh8OYQ) to watch it, if you're yet to.
