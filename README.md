# `react.js` in 2 months
In this repository, I, [Topman Paul-Dike](https://github.com/tpauldike), saved my work with `JavaScript` and `react js` when I made up my mind to become a react developer in 2 months, from *5th May to 5th July, 2023*. I invited my peers to learn with me and several of them responded positively; also contained in this repository are the codes we wrote in the *live learning sessions*.
