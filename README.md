# `react.js` in 2 months
![react.js_sessions](https://github.com/tpauldike/rough_work/blob/main/designs/js-react.jpg)
In this repository, I, [Topman Paul-Dike](https://github.com/tpauldike), saved my work with `JavaScript` and `react.js` when I made up my mind to become a react developer in 2 months, from *5th May to 5th July, 2023*. I invited my peers to learn with me and several of them responded positively; also contained in this repository are the codes we wrote in the *live learning sessions* and the **invaluable contributions** of some of my peers

The live learning sessions were recorded and the videos are available on this [YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU10dryLOLEGEnWCZgG87VkvAi-fPaDfE), if you wish to watch and learn as well.
