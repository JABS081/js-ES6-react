# Session 9; Day 35
In Session 9, we explored essential JavaScript operators and control structures. 

We covered:

- Spread operator & rest operator
- Ternary operator (using ':' and '?' instead of if-else)
- Object property shorthand
- Object.freeze() for immutability
- "use strict" for strict mode
- try-catch for error handling

Stay tuned for upcoming sessions and continue your journey to become a proficient React developer!
