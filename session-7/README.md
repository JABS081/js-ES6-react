# Session 7; Day 31
This session held after some moment of pauses and solo learning in the team, fighting to get other tasks and projects done, especially as students of ALX Africa.

Still ambitious to become `React` developers in the remaining 29 days, we decided to take up a simple web app and develop it from start to finish, frontend & backend. *More info loading...*

In this session, we learned about
- destructuring a nested object
- skipping indices while destructuring an array
- The array methods - `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.reduce()` and `.find()`

The recorded video for this session will be out soon, on [this YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU10dryLOLEGEnWCZgG87VkvAi-fPaDfE).
