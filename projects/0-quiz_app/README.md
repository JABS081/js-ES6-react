# Multiple Choice Quiz App
## About the Project
This is about a simple `JavaScript` program that gives the user some quiz with 4 options (a - d) to choose the correct answer from, and scores the user, each time.

The following functionalities were incorporated in the program:
1. The user's name is stored before the quiz starts
2. Each correct answer attracts 5 marks
3. 3 marks are lost each time the user fails a question
4. Inputing invalid option will cost the user his entire previous scores
5. The final score is printed in the end and the percentage is calcualted, and the user gets some remark.

The program was written and tested on the command line in a Linux environment, using the text editor, `vim`.

## How to run the Quiz App
To run the program you need to:
- get the codes saved on your machine
- ensure it is executable (or run `chomod u+x <file_name>` on the command line)
- in addition to `node js`, intall prompt-sync as follows: `sudo apt update -y ; sudo apt install prompt-sync`
- run the script (`./<file_name>`) or pass it as an argument to `node`, as in `node <file_name>`

## Live Presentation & the Algorithm Used
This project was presented live in this [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/yEcHSZppLog)

If you are interested in the lines of code and the logic behind them, you may want to pay attention to [my algorithm](./my_algorithm.md).

Note that the filed named `test` here is doing nothing but holding the initial codes that I wanted to use to get inputs form the user, the didn't work out well.
