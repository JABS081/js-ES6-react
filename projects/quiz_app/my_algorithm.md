# How I approached the Project
1. Structure the questions and the options inside the variable `quiz`
	- `quiz` as an object
	- `Q1` to `Qn` as an object nested in `quiz`, *where 'n' in 'Qn' is the last question, unknown at the time*
	- `question` as a string property of `Qx`, having its value as the question; *'x' could be any number from 1 to n*
	- `options` as a array of the options provided
