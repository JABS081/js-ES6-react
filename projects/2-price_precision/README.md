# PricePrecision

## About
**PricePrecision** is a demo web app built from start to finish by the team in a bid to put into practice the things we had learned so far and learn more in the process.

**PricePrecision** is a web app that was built to help a shop owner or attendant keep track of the current prices of goods in the store.
In other to implement the CRUD principle, the user is able to:
- add new goods and their prices to his data
- edit or update the prices or product status of already existing goods
- Delete the goods that are not needed anymore
- Retreive a list of the available goods and their prices and status
