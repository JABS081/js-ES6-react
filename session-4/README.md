# Session 4; Day 10
Here, we began to learn about **DOM** and how we could manipulate `html` and `css` files using `JavaScript`.

We demostrated this by creating some simple web pages and making them interactive, and of course, changing the original `html` content.

We ended the session with a particular task undone, which became an assignment to each individual; the assignment was;
> *Make the **Identify yourself** button that is on the web page to ask
for the user's name and respond with a message like "Hello <the_name>"
when the button is clicked.*
